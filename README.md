 a crappy game i made in gdevelop for a school project

# so basically...
as i said above, this is just a game for a school project and made with satirical purposes. this repo serves as the download center and for the source code for my teachers i guess. you can see the games that i built (or compiled whatever) in the releases.

# to the teachers
sorry if there's still some swear words, because i probably might have missed some in previous commits, and i created this repo just for sillies. the game executable is in the releases tab

# for people from the outside
don't expect any further development here cause i'm so burnt up. i've moved on developing in roblox studio, i might continue the development a bit and att some more stuff but idk. this is a school project after all. it's not like i'm getting paid for this. but you're free to fork the repo.

# if somehow this is getting traction...
well even if this is getting some popularity for some unknown reason (which i know this won't ever happen) i still don't think i would work on this again, unless if i felt doing so.

# building the game
you can follow the building instruction on [gdevelop's](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/). sorry but, no mac os or ios version.

# hate building?
just go to the releases tab and enjoy my terrible game. sorry but, no prebuilt mac os or ios version. gdevelop doesn't have the option to do so, probably because apple doesn't give them build tools for free. unlike android.

# bugs?
you are welcome to create an issue. but it's not like even with the tons of issues i could fix the game and the game is fully playable and becomes like idk a triple a game. although, still appreciated i guess.
