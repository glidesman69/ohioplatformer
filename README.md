 # a shit backstory even though this game doesnt have any

 # how 2 downlod
1. go to the releases tab
2. select the latest version available, but don't get fooled by the version number because the game has either a fucked up versioning system or a development reset
3. pick the one for your platform
   - if it's android, pick apk
   - if it's windows, either pick the zip file or installer. if you're dumb just download the installer
   - if it's linux, pick appimage
   - if it's macos then idk. no wait it's a zip file like windows
   - just fucking read the filenames god dammit are u domb
   - if you don't know what the fuck is android, windows, linux, macos or you don't know what's your platform. god help you


# for the people who use iphone or ios or ipad or whatever the fuck
there's no ios version available because fuck apple and i don't have a fucking mac (since it requires something called xcode to build the game which is only available on mac) so i either probably require help from my gf since she has a mac IF SHE COULD USE XCODE. so for iphone users sry

for iphone users the workaround for this is to play the web version which i still haven't published yet which, may or may not be pleasant playing on a browser. but hey what can i do

although tbh i could probably like build the ios version if i have a subscription but hell no
